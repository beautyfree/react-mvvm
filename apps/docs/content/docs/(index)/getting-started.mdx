import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs'
import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps'

## Installation

Run one of the following commands to add React MVVM and all needed libraries:

```package-install tab="mobx-react-lite (recommended)"
react-mvvm mobx mobx-react-lite reflect-metadata
```

```package-install tab="mobx-react"
react-mvvm mobx mobx-react reflect-metadata
```

**Note**: By default, React MVVM uses `mobx-react-lite` (lighter and recommended for most cases). You can configure it to use `mobx-react` if you need Provider/Inject functionality. See [Configuration](/docs/core-concepts/configuration) for more details.

## Preparation

You must import `reflect-metadata` in your main script file so that you can use the decorators. You can also configure this package, but this step is optional.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Import reflect-metadata in your main entry file:

    ```tsx

    import 'reflect-metadata';  // [!code focus]
    import { configure } from 'react-mvvm';
    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

    // Optional step
    configure({
      // Configuration options
    });

    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />);
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    You can use `mobx` with versions **4, 5 or 6**. And it's recommended to use the 6th one.

    In case you want to use versions 4 or 5 you should add the following code to your webpack configuration:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      // ...
      // [!code focus:5]
      ignoreWarnings: [
        {
          module: /react-mvvm/,
        },
      ],
      // ...
    };
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

You can find examples of using this package in [the examples section](/docs/examples).

## Further reading

Despite the fact that React MVVM is an extremely small library, it can greatly affect the development process. For a better understanding of the beauty of this library, we advise you to read an [article about MobX and MVVM](https://dev.to/yoskutik/mobx-with-mvvm-makes-frontend-developers-life-much-more-easier-than-redux-does-547j).
