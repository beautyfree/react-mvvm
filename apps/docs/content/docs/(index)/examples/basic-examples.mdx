## View and ChildView

The interfaces of `view` and `childView` are pretty much the same. The only difference - the way the view model is typed.

### Using `childView`

The component which was created with `childView` must be used somewhere inside a view of the same view model.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
// [!code focus]
import { view, childView } from 'react-mvvm'
import { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

// [!code focus]
export const ChildView = childView<SomeViewModel>()(({ viewModel }) => <div />)

// [!code focus:3]
// ChildView does not create a view model and should be located somewhere inside a view.
// Thus, it can use view's view model.
export const View1 = view(SomeViewModel)(({ viewModel }) => <ChildView />)

// [!code focus:2]
// It doesn't have to be the direct child
export const View2 = view(SomeViewModel)(({ viewModel }) => (
  <div>
    // [!code focus]
    <ChildView />
  </div>
))
```

### Typing props

By default, `view` and `childView` returns an `FC` component with no props. But you can type it using `FC` type.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
// [!code focus]
import { view, childView } from 'react-mvvm'
import { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

// [!code focus:3]
// View1 and ChildView1 don't have any props
export const View1 = view(SomeViewModel)(({ viewModel }) => <div />)
export const ChildView1 = childView<SomeViewModel>()(({ viewModel }) => <div />)

// [!code focus:4]
export type Props = {
  prop1: number // A required prop
  prop2?: string // An optional prop
}

// [!code focus:3]
export const View2 = view(SomeViewModel)<Props>(
  ({ viewModel, prop1, prop2 }) => <div />
)

// [!code focus:3]
export const ChildView = childView<SomeViewModel>()<Props>(
  ({ viewModel, prop1, prop2 }) => <div />
)

// [!code focus:3]
// And now you can pass the props
// <View2 prop1={2} prop2="prop2" />
// <ChildView2 prop1={2} prop2="prop2" />
```

### Setting options

By default, `view` and `childView` create a memoized observer component. You can make it non-observer or pass `propsAreEqual` function to the `memo` HOC.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
// [!code focus]
import { view, childView } from 'react-mvvm'
import { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

// [!code focus:3]
// View1 and ChildView1 are observers and they are memoized
export const View1 = view(SomeViewModel)(({ viewModel }) => <div />)
export const ChildView1 = childView<SomeViewModel>()(({ viewModel }) => <div />)

// [!code focus:4]
// View2 and ChildView2 are not observers now, but they still memoized with default behaviour
export const View2 = view(SomeViewModel)(({ viewModel }) => <div />, {
  observer: false,
})
// [!code focus]
export const ChildView2 = childView<SomeViewModel>()(
  ({ viewModel }) => <div />,
  // [!code focus]
  { observer: false }
)

type Props = {
  prop1: number
}

// [!code focus:3]
const propsAreEqual = (prevProps: Props, nextProps: Props) => {
  // logic here
}

// [!code focus:4]
// And this is how you can change propsAreEqual function for the memo
export const View3 = view(SomeViewModel)<Props>(({ viewModel }) => <div />, {
  propsAreEqual,
})
// [!code focus]
export const ChildView3 = childView<SomeViewModel>()<Props>(
  ({ viewModel }) => <div />,
  // [!code focus]
  { propsAreEqual }
)
```

### Using `forwardRef`

Of course, there's an opportunity to pass a ref via `view` and `childView`. You just need to apply `forwardRef` before applying these functions. Also, if you want to type the component, you have to use second generic.

```tsx
import React, { forwardRef } from 'react'
// [!code focus]
import { view, childView } from 'react-mvvm'
import { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

// [!code focus:4]
// Only ref with no props
export const View1 = view(SomeViewModel)<unknown, HTMLDivElement>(
  forwardRef(({ viewModel }, ref) => <div ref={ref} />)
)

// [!code focus:3]
export const ChildView1 = childView<SomeViewModel>()<unknown, HTMLDivElement>(
  forwardRef(({ viewModel }, ref) => <div ref={ref} />)
)

type Props = {
  prop1: number
}

// [!code focus:4]
// With props
export const View2 = view(SomeViewModel)<Props, HTMLDivElement>(
  forwardRef(({ viewModel, prop1 }, ref) => <div ref={ref} />)
)

// [!code focus:3]
export const ChildView2 = childView<SomeViewModel>()<Props, HTMLDivElement>(
  forwardRef(({ viewModel, prop1 }, ref) => <div ref={ref} />)
)
```

### Using class components

We do not recommend writing new code with class-style components. However, we give you the opportunity to use the MVVM pattern for class components as well. A class component can't be a view, only a ChildView. However, you can additionally use the `view` function to wrap your ChildView to make it act as view.

```tsx
// [!code focus]
import { ChildViewComponent, view } from 'react-mvvm'
import { SomeViewModel } from './SomeViewModel'

type Props = {
  prop1: number
}

// [!code focus:2]
// This is a child view. It should be used somewhere inside a view with SomeViewModel view model
export class SomeChildView extends ChildViewComponent<SomeViewModel, Props> {
  render() {
    // [!code focus]
    return <div>{this.viewModel.field}</div>
  }
}

// [!code focus:3]
// But if you want to make it act as view, you can wrap it with the view function
export default view(SomeViewModel)<Props>((props) => (
  <SomeChildView {...props} />
))
```

## ViewModel

### Typing `parent` and `viewProps`

View models have link to their parents and also have link to view's props. And you can type both of these fields.

```tsx
// [!code focus]
import { ViewModel } from 'react-mvvm'
import type { ParentViewModel } from './ParentViewModel'
import type { Props } from './path-to-view-props'

// [!code focus:2]
// No typings. parent is unknown, viewProps is unknown
export class SomeViewModel1 extends ViewModel {}

// [!code focus:2]
// Parent is ParentViewModel, viewProps is unknown
export class SomeViewModel2 extends ViewModel<ParentViewModel> {}

// [!code focus:2]
// Parent is ParentViewModel, viewProps is Props
export class SomeViewModel3 extends ViewModel<ParentViewModel, Props> {}

// [!code focus:2]
// Parent is unknown, viewProps is Props
export class SomeViewModel4 extends ViewModel<unknown, Props> {}
```

### Using `parent`

If a view is located somewhere inside another view, inner view can use outer one's view model.

```tsx
// [!code focus]
import { view, ViewModel } from 'react-mvvm'

// [!code focus:2]
class ViewModel1 extends ViewModel {
  doSomething = () => {}
}

// [!code focus:5]
class ViewModel2 extends ViewModel<ViewModel1> {
  onClick = () => {
    this.parent.doSomething()
  }
}

// [!code focus:5]
// View2 must be located somewhere inside View1. Thus, view model of View1 will be a parent view model for View2
const View2 = view(ViewModel2)(({ viewModel }) => (
  <button onClick={viewModel.onClick} />
))

// [!code focus]
const View1 = view(ViewModel1)(({ viewModel }) => (
  <div>
    // [!code focus]
    <View2 />
  </div>
))
```

### Observing `viewProps`

The `viewProps` field updates every time the view is rendered with new props. The view is memoized, so the amount of updates is minimized. But you need to keep in mind a few rules when you want to observe `viewProps`. If you are using `viewProps` inside an `autorun` or an observer component (`observer`, `view` or `childView`), when the reaction will be called every time the view is rendered with new props.

```tsx
import { computed, makeObservable } from 'mobx'
// [!code focus]
import { view, childView, ViewModel } from 'react-mvvm'

type Props = {
  prop1: number
  prop2: string
}

// [!code focus]
export class SomeViewModel extends ViewModel<unknown, Props> {
  // [!code focus:3]
  @computed get prop1() {
    return this.viewProps.prop1
  }

  constructor() {
    super()
    makeObservable(this)

    // [!code focus:4]
    // This autorun will be called every time the view gets any new prop, even if the prop1 didn't change
    this.autorun(() => {
      console.log(this.viewProps.prop1)
    })

    // [!code focus:7]
    // This reaction will be called only if the prop has changed
    this.reaction(
      () => this.viewProps.prop1,
      () => {
        console.log(this.viewProps.prop1)
      }
    )

    // [!code focus:4]
    // This autorun will be called only if the prop has changed
    this.autorun(() => {
      console.log(this.prop1)
    })
  }
}

// [!code focus]
const SomeChildView = childView<SomeViewModel>()(({ viewModel }) => (
  <div>
    // [!code focus:2]
    {/* If you use the line below, SomeChildView will be re-rendered every time SomeView get any new prop */}
    {viewModel.viewProps.prop1}

    // [!code focus:2]
    {/* If you use the line below, SomeChildView will be re-rendered only if prop1 was changed */}
    {viewModel.prop1}
  </div>
))

// [!code focus]
const SomeView = view(SomeViewModel)<Props>(() => <SomeChildView />)
```

### View lifecycle hooks

You add handle some of the view lifecycle state changes, such as mounting, unmounting and updating. There are 3 methods for each hook in the `ViewModel`.

```tsx
import { ViewModel } from 'react-mvvm'

// Hooks can be sync and async. Also, they can be decorated with @action or other decorators
export class SomeViewModel extends ViewModel {
  protected onViewMounted() {
    console.log(
      'View has been mounted. This function is called in the useEffect hook'
    )
  }

  protected onViewMountedSync() {
    console.log(
      'View has been mounted. This function is called in the useLayoutEffect hook'
    )
  }

  protected onViewUpdated() {
    console.log(
      'View has been updated. This function is called in the useEffect hook'
    )
  }

  protected onViewUpdatedSync() {
    console.log(
      'View has been updated. This function is called in the useLayoutEffect hook'
    )
  }

  protected onViewUnmounted() {
    console.log(
      'View has been unmounted. This function is called in the useEffect hook'
    )
  }

  protected onViewUnmountedSync() {
    console.log(
      'View has been unmounted. This function is called in the useLayoutEffect hook'
    )
  }
}
```

### Creating reactions

To observe anything in a view model, you _should_ use ViewModel's `reaction`, `autorun` and `addDisposer` methods. These methods are added to automatically dispose reactions, when the view becomes unmounted. You can also not to use these methods, but in these case there can be a probability of a memory leak formation.

```tsx
import { intercept, makeObservable, observable, observe, when } from 'mobx'
// [!code focus]
import { ViewModel } from 'react-mvvm'

// [!code focus]
export class SomeViewModel extends ViewModel {
  // [!code focus]
  @observable field = 0

  constructor() {
    super()
    makeObservable(this)

    // [!code focus:5]
    // If you want to create a reaction, please, use this.reaction instead of reaction from the mobx package
    this.reaction(
      () => this.field,
      (value) => this.doSomething(value)
    )

    // [!code focus:4]
    // If you want to create an autorun, please, use this.reaction instead of reaction from the mobx package
    this.autorun(() => {
      this.doSomething(this.field)
    })

    // [!code focus:2]
    // In case you want to create other type of observation, such as observe, intercept or when, you can use
    // this.addDisposer

    // [!code focus:4]
    // observe
    this.addDisposer(
      observe(this, 'field', ({ newValue }) => this.doSomething(newValue))
    )

    // [!code focus:7]
    // intercept
    this.addDisposer(
      intercept(this, 'field', (change) => {
        this.doSomething(change.newValue)
        return change
      })
    )

    // [!code focus:4]
    // when
    const w = when(() => this.field === 1)
    w.then(() => this.doSomething(this.field))
    this.addDisposer(() => w.cancel())
  }

  doSomething = (field: number) => {}
}
```

## Configuration

### Configuring `vmFactory`

`vmFactory` tells to views how they should create an instance of a view model. You can configure this function to add debug information or a middleware.

```tsx
import { configure } from 'react-mvvm'

configure({
  vmFactory: (VM) => {
    // By default, vmFactory returns new VM();

    const viewModel = new VM()

    // But you can do anything here
    // Add debug information
    console.log('view model created:', viewModel)

    // Or process your view model somehow
    ;(viewModel as any).__some_special_field = 'some special value'

    // vmFactory must return an instance of a ViewModel
    return viewModel
  },
})
```

### Configuring `Wrapper`

The `Wrapper` is used to wrap all the views and childViews. By default, the `Wrapper` is equal to `React.Fragment` so it doesn't really affect on your application. But you can set any component as wrapper to add debug information or a middleware.

```tsx
// [!code focus]
import { configure } from 'react-mvvm'
import { Component, FC, ReactElement } from 'react'

// [!code focus:3]
// The Wrapper can be declared both with functional style or as class
// It must have children as a prop, at it should return a children. Otherwise, your views will not be shown.
const FunctionalWrapper: FC<{ children: ReactElement }> = ({ children }) => {
  // You can add a debug info
  console.log('view is rendered')

  // [!code focus:2]
  // You should return children
  return children
}

// [!code focus:2]
// You can also use class components
class ClassWrapper extends Component<{ children: ReactElement }> {
  render() {
    // [!code focus:7]
    // You should also return processed children
    return (
      <div>
        <span>Wrapper content</span>
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

// [!code focus:3]
configure({
  Wrapper: FunctionalWrapper,
})

// [!code focus:3]
configure({
  Wrapper: ClassWrapper,
})
```
