description: Understanding the childView function and its usage

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs'

## Overview

As the `view`, the `childView` function creates an object that also implements the view logic from the MVVM pattern. But there's a big difference in these functions - ChildView does not call `vmFactory` and uses a view's view model as own one.

By default, every child view is an observer and is memoized. And you can change it. The options of creating view child is same as for view.

## Usage

```typescript
childView()(Component[, options])
```

See using ChildView: [Example](/docs/examples/basic-examples#using-childview).

### Options

See setting options: [Example](/docs/examples/basic-examples#setting-options).

## Usage Example

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import { childView } from 'react-mvvm'
import type { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

export type Props = {
  prop1: number
  prop2?: string
}

export const SomeChildView = childView<SomeViewModel>()<Props>(
  ({ viewModel, prop1, prop2 }) => (
    <div>
      {viewModel.field1}
      {prop1}
      {prop2}
    </div>
  )
)
```

## ChildViewComponent

We highly recommend using React MVVM with functional style components. But to increase compatibility, we added a class `ChildViewComponent`, so you can create instances of ChildView as class components.

<Callout type="info">
  If you want to create an instance of View as class component, please see the
  [example](/docs/examples/basic-examples#using-class-components).
</Callout>

The only difference between class-style ChildView and functional-style ChildView is that in the class-style `viewModel` field is part of class, while in the function-style it's a property. And since functional-style child views are declared with `memo`, `ChildViewComponent` is extended from `PureComponent`.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import { ChildViewComponent } from 'react-mvvm'
import { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

export type Props = {
  prop1: number
  prop2?: string
}

class SomeChildView extends ChildViewComponent<SomeViewModel, Props> {
  render() {
    return (
      // viewModel is a class member, not a property of the component
      <div>{this.viewModel.field1}</div>
    )
  }
}
```
