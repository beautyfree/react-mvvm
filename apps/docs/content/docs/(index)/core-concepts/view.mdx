import { Tabs, Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs'

## Overview

The `view` function creates an object that implements the view logic from the MVVM pattern. This means that view should be responsible for displaying a component in your application.

A view takes a `vmFactory` from the `configuration` and call it to create an instance of a view model. Also view is responsible for updating view model's fields `parent` and `viewProps` and for calling view's lifecycle hooks in the instance of a view model.

By default, every view is an observer. But you can configure it.

<Callout>
  One of the issues that solves this package is the purity of the code. The
  fewer props your components have, the easier it will be to understand your
  code for others. And with this package you can minimize amount of props passed
  by observing view model's fields, its parent's fields and so on. For example,
  a ChildView can observe its View props.
</Callout>

**Every view is memoized**. And as it states below, the fewer props your view having, the faster your application will work. Since the view uses `memo` function, you can also pass the `propsAreEqual` function to it.

## Usage

```tsx
view(SomeViewModel)(Component[, options])
```

### Options

There are two options: `observer` and `propsAreEqual`. If `observer` is `false`, when view will be created as non-observer component. And if `propsAreEqual` is set, it will be passed to a `memo` function (See [how memo works](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) for better understanding).

See setting view options: [Example](/docs/examples/basic-examples#setting-options).

## Usage Example

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { view } from 'react-mvvm' // [!code focus]
import { SomeViewModel } from './path-to-view-model'

export type Props = {
  prop1: number
  prop2?: string
}

// [!code focus]
export const SomeView = view(SomeViewModel)<Props>(
  (
    { viewModel, prop1, prop2 } // [!code focus]
  ) => (
    <div>
      {viewModel.field1} // [!code focus]
      {prop1}
      {prop2}
    </div>
  )
)
```
